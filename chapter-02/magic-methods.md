# Magic Methods and Operator Overloading

Python has special methods that are usually called *Magic Methods* or *Dunder Methods*.
These methods have a specific syntax, i.e. the double underscores at the beginning and the end.
The most common dunder method that you will see is `__init__` because it acts like a constructor for your class.

These special methods are useful in many ways and you can use to:

- customize attribute access
- customize class creation
- customize instance and subclass checks
- emulate callable objects
- emulate container types
- emulate numeric types
- create context managers
- and others
